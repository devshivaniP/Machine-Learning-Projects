## Movie Rating Prediction

### Purpose

The purpose of this project is to develop a machine learning model that can accurately predict movie ratings. This helps streaming services and movie recommendation systems provide personalized recommendations to users.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this project is the [IMDB Movies India dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/adrianmcmahon/imdb-india-movies), which contains millions of ratings and tag applications across thousands of movies. This dataset includes user ratings, movie information, and user demographics.

### Key Features

- Data Preprocessing: Handling missing values, encoding categorical features, and splitting data into training and testing sets.
- Feature Engineering: Creating new features to improve model performance.
- Model Training: Training various machine learning models to predict movie ratings.
- Model Evaluation: Evaluating model performance using metrics such as MAPE (Mean Absolute Percentage Error) and accuracy. 
- Predictive Analysis: Using the trained model to predict ratings for new movies or users.

### Technologies Used

- Programming Languages: Python
- Libraries: Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Tools: Jupyter Lab, Git

### Usage

#### Training the Model

1. Open the Jupyter Notebook.
2. Open the `IMDB Movie Rating.ipynb` file.
3. Run the notebook cells to preprocess the data, train the model, and evaluate its performance.

#### Evaluating the Model

The model evaluation section in the notebook includes various metrics to assess the performance of the rating prediction model. Metrics include accuracy and MAPE(Mean Absolute Percentage Error).

#### Predicting Ratings

To use the trained model for predicting fraud on new movies or users, you can run the prediction section in the notebook.

## Iris Flower Classification

### Purpose

The purpose of this project is to build a machine learning model that can accurately classify iris flowers into one of three species based on their sepal and petal measurements. This project serves as a demonstration of basic machine learning techniques and practices.

### Dataset

The dataset used for this project is the famous [Iris Flower Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/arshid/iris-flower-dataset). It consists of 150 samples, each with four features: sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width. There are 50 samples for each of the three species.

### Key Features

- Data Preprocessing: Handling missing values, scaling features, and splitting data into training and testing sets.
- Model Training: Training various machine learning models to classify iris species.
- Model Evaluation: Evaluating model performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
